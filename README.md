# Tomorrow Land

Tomorrow Land is designed for one purpose -- easy, simple budgeting.

It doesn't connect to your bank or keep up with your transactions.

It DOES give you a focussed space to effortlessly assemble your monthly budget.

When you add spending items, Tomorrow Land self-categorizes them, shows a dynamic balance, and keeps the input fields close together. No scrolling required.

It also gives you a randomly-selected, money-relevant verse from the Bible to help you keep things in perspective.

Are you a tither? Put your income in first, then start typing "tithe" in the outgo section. A value will automatically appear based on your income.

Current categories for spending include :

- Giving
- Debt
- Utilities
- Food / Gas (part of the Dave Ramsey "four walls")
- Subscriptions
- Other

The sorting function is always being updated, and miscategorizations will occur, especially in this app's youth. Please notify me if you discover a miscategorization, and I'll work to correct it.

Thanks for using Tomorrow Land, where we shape tomorrow today.
